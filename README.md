## [Project 6 Assembler](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project06)
Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code.
## [Project 7: Virtual Machine I - Stack Arithmetic](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project07)
Build a basic VM translator, focusing on the implementation of the VM language's stack arithmetic and memory accesscommands.
## [Project 8: Virtual Machine II - Program Control](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project08)
Extend the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, in project 7 we focused on handling the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.  
## [Project 10: Compiler I - Syntax Analysis](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project10)
Build a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the program's structure using marked-up text.
